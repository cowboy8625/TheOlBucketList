# My Very Own Language

For the last two or three years I have been going down a deeper and deeper
path of learning how programming language work. The quest to create my very
own general purpose language has gone from a small curiousness to a deep desire.

I have made a few languages in using a verity of language, from python, C, Zig,
Ocaml to Rust. None have been self hosted and that truly is the dream.

Snow lang is my current favorite that I have made and it is functional language
made with Rust.
